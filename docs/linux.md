# UE4SS on Linux (this fork)

This fork (`linux` branch) builds and runs the official UE4SS inside **native Linux Unreal Engine
games** (dedicated servers built for Linux), loaded with `LD_PRELOAD`. It keeps the official code
and mechanisms - patternsleuth AOB scans, `UE4SS_Signatures`, `VTableLayout.ini`, Lua mods - and
changes only what Linux needs. Windows games running under Proton/Wine use the official Windows
build, not this one.

## Supported and tested games

Tested on the real dedicated server of each game, in Docker, with a probe Lua mod that runs
`FindFirstOf` (it must find the map's GameState), `StaticFindObject`, `RegisterHook` on Blueprint and
native functions, `ExecuteInGameThread` and `NotifyOnNewObject`, with every default hook enabled.

| Game | Engine | Per-game files | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RuneScape: Dragonwilds | 5.6.1, modified | from the server's `.sym` | works |
| Palworld | 5.1.1 | none (built-in layout) | works (10 min, hooks from worker threads) |
| Pavlov VR | 5.1 | none (built-in layout) | works |
| Soulmask | 4.27 | reference pack (62 extra virtuals in AGameModeBase) | works |
| The Front | 4.27 | reference pack (FUObjectArray +0x18, `UE4SS_TARGET_EXE`) | works; crashed once at startup in four runs (not explained) |
| Smalland: Survive the Wilds | 4.27 | reference pack | works |
| Insurgency: Sandstorm | 4.27 | reference pack | works |
| Astro Colony | 4.27 | reference pack (`UE4SS_TARGET_EXE`) | works |
| Squad 44 | 4.27 | from its `.sym` (it is the 4.27 reference) | works |
| MORDHAU | 4.26 | from its `.sym` (the 4.26 reference) | works |
| HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed | 4.26 | reference pack | works |
| The Bus | 5.6 | reference pack (`UE4SS_TARGET_EXE`) | works |
| VEIN | 5.6 | from its `.sym` (the 5.6 reference) | works |
| Squad | 5.7 | reference pack (`UE4SS_TARGET_EXE`) | works |
| QANGA | 5.7 | from its `.sym` (the 5.7 reference) | works |

Not working yet: Citadel: Forged with Fire (4.21: the probe runs, then the server crashes).
No reference game with symbols for 4.18, 4.22, 4.25, 5.2 and 5.4, so StickyBots, Tower Unite,
Operation: Harsh Doorstop, Modiverse, Day of Dragons and Nightingale are not supported.
Not tested: Linux game **clients** (the GUI and hotkeys are not built on Linux:
`UE4SS_GUI_ENABLED`/`UE4SS_INPUT_ENABLED` are off). C++ mods: Dragonwilds only (below).

### Why a game needs its own files

Every studio changes engine classes. Measured on the 4.27 servers above: Soulmask adds 62 virtuals
to `AGameModeBase`, The Front adds 0x18 bytes to `FUObjectArray` before the listener arrays, and
Squad 44 adds one virtual to `AActor`. A layout per engine version is not enough - with it, more
than half of these servers crashed. What carries over between two games of one version is the code
of each engine function (same compiler, same source), and the target's own vtables, which Unreal
servers export in `.dynsym` (`_ZTV*`).

`tools/linux-layouts/ue_reference_pack.py` turns one game that ships symbols (`.sym` and `.debug`)
into a **reference pack** for its engine version: the complete vtable layout from the DWARF, a
fingerprint of each slot, masked code for each signature, and how often the code touches each
`FUObjectArray` member. From a pack and a target executable, the game panel's generator
(`ue_linux_layout.py`, plain stdlib) writes that game's `VTableLayout.ini` (slots aligned by
code), `UE4SS_Signatures/` (the shortest prefix of the reference's code unique in the target, never
shorter than unique in the reference), `GMalloc.lua`/`ConsoleManager.lua` checked at run time
against the allocator's / `FConsoleManager`'s exported vtable, and `MemberVariableLayout.ini` when
the `FUObjectArray` access histogram is shifted. The release ships the packs in
`LinuxReferencePacks.tar.gz`.

### RuneScape: Dragonwilds

Jagex's 5.6.1 changes engine classes, and its build hides `FName::ToString`, the FName constructor
and `StaticConstructObject_Internal` from patternsleuth's scans: UE4SS rescans until
`SecondsToScanBeforeGivingUp` and never starts. The server ships its `.sym` (no `.debug`), so its
`VTableLayout.ini` and `UE4SS_Signatures/` are generated from it (see Installing). Beyond the probe
Lua mod, Dragonwilds is tested with:

- a Lua mod released for the Windows build, run unchanged. It needed two fixes: its `Scripts`
  directory found on a case-sensitive filesystem, and its `\`-joined paths opened by `io.open` (see
  Lua mods below);
- C++ probe mods: `StaticFindObject`, `FindFirstOf` (from `on_update`, once the engine object
  exists), log output, and exceptions thrown and caught inside a mod, thrown by UE4SS and caught by
  a mod, and thrown by a mod's `start_mod` and caught by UE4SS (logged as a mod that failed to
  load).

## Installing

From a release of this fork (`linux-*` tags): `libUE4SS.so`, `UE4SS-settings.ini` and
`ue4ss-mods-shared.tar.gz` (the Lua libraries of `Mods/shared`), with `SHA256SUMS`.

```
<Game>/Binaries/Linux/<Game>-Linux-Shipping      the game
<Game>/Binaries/Linux/ue4ss/libUE4SS.so
<Game>/Binaries/Linux/ue4ss/UE4SS-settings.ini
<Game>/Binaries/Linux/ue4ss/Mods/shared/...      from ue4ss-mods-shared.tar.gz
<Game>/Binaries/Linux/ue4ss/Mods/mods.txt
```

Start the game with `LD_PRELOAD=<...>/ue4ss/libUE4SS.so` (for a systemd service, an
`Environment=LD_PRELOAD=...` drop-in). The library starts only in a process whose executable name
contains `-Linux-` (or is `UE4SS_TARGET_EXE`), so the launcher script and the tools it runs are
left alone. `UE4SS.log` is written next to the library.

For a game with a modified engine (Dragonwilds), generate its files from the `.sym` the server
ships and put them in the same `ue4ss/` folder:

```bash
python3 tools/linux-layouts/ue_vtable_layout.py <executable> assets/VTableLayoutTemplates/VTableLayout_5_06_Template.ini > ue4ss/VTableLayout.ini
python3 tools/linux-layouts/ue_signatures_from_sym.py <executable> ue4ss/UE4SS_Signatures
```

A C++ mod is a shared object, `ue4ss/Mods/<Mod>/dlls/main.so` (or `dlls/<Mod>.so`), exporting
`start_mod` and `uninstall_mod`. Build it with `target_link_libraries(<mod> PUBLIC UE4SS)`, which on
Linux also links the mod's C++ runtime the way `libUE4SS.so` links its own (see below). It binds to
the UE4SS and Unreal API that `libUE4SS.so` exports. Only a `std::exception` thrown from `start_mod`
is caught.

## What changed for Linux, and why

- **Build**: Linux platform type and Clang 19 or newer (clang 18 hides libstdc++'s `std::expected`,
  which glaze needs); GUI and input optional; Windows-only libraries behind `WIN32`; POSIX ports of
  the file, mutex and scanner layers; `LD_PRELOAD` constructor entry. CI builds
  `Game__Shipping__Linux` on Ubuntu 26.04 with Clang 22 (the `build-linux` job of
  `.github/workflows/cmake-ci.yml`).
- **Running inside the game**: libstdc++ and the unwinder are linked in and bound locally (the game
  exports its own libc++abi/libunwind, and every `throw` inside UE4SS died in them). A mod linking
  the `UE4SS` target inherits the same runtime flags (the game also exports `operator new/delete`),
  and both run one `throw` as they load: an exception crossing between a mod and UE4SS otherwise
  reaches a copy of the unwinder that has never run, and the game aborts. Each keeps its own
  exception state, so after an exception crosses between them `std::uncaught_exceptions()` is off
  in both, and `std::current_exception()` or `throw;` sees only exceptions caught on its own side.
- **patternsleuth** reads the ELF image (`image-elf`).
- **Itanium ABI**: the FName constructor takes `this` first; `ProcessLocalScriptFunction` is the
  tail jump of `ProcessInternal` under Clang; `ULocalPlayer::Exec` comes from the primary vtable.
- **Layouts**: vtable and member offsets of each engine version generated from Epic's source with
  clang (`tools/linux-layouts`, see its README): Itanium orders vtables differently and reuses tail
  padding, and platform types change size (`FRWLock`).
- **Lua**: `RegisterHook` callbacks take the Lua state lock (a hooked function can run on a worker
  thread; not Linux-specific).
- **`VTableLayout.ini` reader**: it asked `Version::IsBelow(4, 25)` before the engine version is known
  (still -1), so every `FProperty` offset was stacked on the UObject chain; an `[FField]` section now
  says the inheritance (FField only exists from 4.25 on). Not Linux-specific.
- **patternsleuth image on Linux** (`patternsleuth_bind/src/linux_image.rs`): the ELF was parsed from
  memory, where the section header table falls in `.bss` - garbage once the game wrote there, past
  the image, or in the holes between 2 MiB-aligned segments. The headers now come from
  `/proc/self/exe`, and only mapped segments are read.
- **Exports** (`UE4SS/linux_exports.map`): a preloaded library comes first in every lookup of the
  process, so its standard template instantiations were used by the game's own plugins (Mordhau's
  mod.io SDK aborted, Sandstorm's allocator saw foreign blocks). Exported: names containing `RC::`
  (the UE4SS and Unreal API, with its typeinfo, vtables and statics), `SharedObjectManager`, Lua's
  C API and `LuaLibrary`'s functions. Standard-library instantiations stay local. CI links a probe
  mod and checks that it binds to these exports, not to copies of its own (`tools/linux-mod-check`).
- **Layouts from DWARF** (`tools/linux-layouts/ue_layout_from_dwarf.py`): the same bodies as the
  source tools, read from a server's `.debug` - no Unreal source or UnrealBuildTool needed.
- **Lua mods**: a mod's `Scripts` directory is found in either case (mods ship `Scripts`, and
  discovery looked for `scripts` only), and `io.open`, `io.lines`, `io.input`, `io.output`,
  `dofile`, `loadfile`, `os.remove` and `os.rename` turn every `\` of a path into `/`
  (Windows-authored mods join paths with `\`), so a filename containing a literal `\` cannot be
  used with them.
